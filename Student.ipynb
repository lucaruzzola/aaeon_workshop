    "### What is computer vision\n",
    "*\"**Computer vision** is concerned with the automatic extraction, analysis and understanding of useful information from a single image or a sequence of images. It involves the development of a theoretical and algorithmic basis to achieve automatic visual understanding.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is deep learning\n",
    "*\"**Deep Learning** is a class of machine learning algorithms that use a cascade of multiple layers of nonlinear processing units for feature extraction and transformation to learn multiple levels of representations that correspond to different levels of abstraction; the levels form a hierarchy of concepts.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"**Machine Learning** is the discipline that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"**AI** is the discipline dealing with the designing and building of intelligent agents that receive percepts from the environment and take actions that affect that environment.\"*\n",

    "### What is a CNN\n",
    "A **CNN** is a neural network that uses kernel convolution instead of matrix multiplication in one or more of its layers.\n",

    "\n",
    "Traditional techniques, like Viola-Jones used custom-engineered features, and work quite well without the need to train them, however they are quite brittle and make somewhat strict assumptions.\n",
    "Modern techniques like MobileNetSSD are more precise and particularly more resilient, they can account for more variation in a face and its position in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "MobileNetSSD is a very popular CNN architecture for general object detection, especially used on low power devices, and as every deep learning model requires quite a bit of expertise to train and deploy.\n",
    "However thanks to OpenVINO and its model zoo it's nowadays possible to use it just like any other library you encounter in you daily workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can simply load the model and use to get the bounding boxes of every face in an image, however there is still quite a bit of code that you need to write to be able to use it effectively and even more easily, and we will later see how easy this can get when you have the necessary tools in place, to be able to go from thinking about a single model, to thinking about a complete AI solution."
